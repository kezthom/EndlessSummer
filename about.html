      <h3>The Global Nutrition Cluster</h3> 
      <p>The GNC Technical Alliance (the Alliance) is the technical arm of the Global Nutrition Cluster. It was created in 2017 to improve the quality of nutrition preparedness, response and recovery, by providing coordinated, accessible and timely technical support through multiple channels, filling gaps where they exist. The Alliance has advisers available for remote and in-person technical support, and provides access to technical guidance and learning for anyone who requires it. The Alliance is led by UNICEF with World Vision International as co-lead. It’s leadership team also includes ENN, Action Against Hunger Canada and the GNC coordination team.

        The Global Nutrition Cluster Technical Alliance supports countries, agencies, and nutrition practitioners in humanitarian situations with technical assistance to meet the nutrition rights and needs of people affected by emergencies.
        
        What we do as part of the Alliance 
        ENN plays a key role within the Alliance;
        
        We oversee the work of the Global Thematic Working Groups (GTWGs) - groups of technical experts who the Alliance calls on to provide guidance where answers to questions from practitioners cannot be found within existing guidelines and tools.
        We co-chair the Wasting GTWG which provides guidance and learning in response to technical queries that are raised.  
        We coordinate the MAMI Global Network which undertakes the role of the MAMI GTWG providing guidance and learning for MAMI-related technical queries as they arise.
        We coordinate the IFE Core Group which is the GTWG on Infant and Young Child Feeding in Emergencies, operating similarly to the MAMI Global Network.
        We develop learning and knowledge management products to fill identified needs
        ENN's online discussion forum en-net is one of the key resources that the GNC Technical Alliance links to (see below).
        Do you need technical nutrition support and assistance in your country?
        The GNC Technical Alliance Support Team of nutrition advisors and experts are ready to answer your questions and support you in-country or remotely. Get in touch here
        
         If you would like to obtain 'peer to peer' technical advice on specific questions, you can do so through ENN's en-net platform which links to an extensive network of nutrition colleagues and experts for advice and guidance.
        
        The Alliance team is particularly keen to reach out to local NGOs who would like support. The GNC Localization Learning Package highlights how the GNC Technical Alliance can support their technical needs - available in English, French, Spanish, Arabic and Somali. This brief was prepared for the Alliance by ENN with members of the Alliance’s Technical Support Team. You can also listen to our Podcast on the subject.</p>

      <h3>Capactiy Development</h3>
      <p>ENN's flagship publication Field Exchange contributes to the capacity development of authors to reflect, write and learn from their experiences. 

        ENN also partners with UN agencies, NGOs and academic institutions to create training programmes and tools that aim to build the capacity of individuals involved in different aspects of nutrition in emergencies. These include e-learning materials and other resources that can be used in a variety of different contexts by nutrition and health professionals, relief workers and others involved in emergency nutrition and food security. Recent resources include: 
        
        NutVal version 4
        Harmonised Training Package (HTP) version 2
        Nutrition in Emergencies (NiE) Regional Training Initiative</p>
